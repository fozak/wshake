<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hope this mail finds you well!</p>
<p>Your ERPNext newsletter's name has been changed to Frappe. We were writing a recap of all operations that were done under Frappe as a firm, not necessarily changes in the ERPNext product, despite the fact that it was called The ERPNext Newsletter. As a result, the name has been changed.</p>
<p>At Frappe, June was a crazy, high-spirited month! We had the Frappe Premier League and played football. Teammates from other stations came to play, and the office was packed to the point that we couldn't find a seat. Some people loved working at their desks, some near the window. The office was a noisy environment. We devoted one full day to the open day because the strength was good. It was both stressful and enjoyable.</p>
<p>This song encapsulates our intensity on and off the field, to sum up, the spirit:</p>

</img></a>
</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what the last leg of the first quarter looked like?</p>
<h2 id="iso-audit-internal">ISO Audit - Internal</h2>
<p>You've probably heard that Frappe is ISO compliant. An internal audit was conducted to check that all departments are continuing to follow the processes established in accordance with ISO rules. We are correcting the flaws and preparing for the external audit. This should happen by October 2022.</p>
<h2 id="your-right-to-internet-freedom">Your right to internet freedom</h2>
<p>Freedom is one of Frappe's founding beliefs. We have a lot of flexibility here, including the ability to choose our work, our compensation, and the time and location of our work. While all of this is positive, we are concerned about our organization, which is a digital platform that runs on the internet and connects us to individuals all over the world. We discussed how things are turning upside down as a result of the regulations governing internet freedom. One adjustment can effectively close a firm and have a significant influence on people's lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9Ld9bRMwBKg">Here are some thoughts on the right to internet freedom</a> covered by our teammate. Take a look. </p>
<p><img alt="iff" src="https://frappe.io/files/Internet%20Freedom.jpeg" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<h2 id="pick-your-own-work">Pick your own work</h2>
<p>In continuation of the preceding paragraph, I mentioned freedom as one of the first principles. The team discusses what it's like to choose your own work in this video. Watch this video to learn more about <a href="https://youtu.be/kVVzu0VpbD4">Frappe's "pick your own work" policy</a> and how it allows our teammates to give it their all.</p>

<p><img alt="tyler" src="https://frappe.io/files/Tyler%20Matteson.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<h2 id="partner-certifications">Partner Certifications</h2>
<p>We ensure that the listed partners are knowledgeable about the product and follow defined procedures. Our partners are expected to successfully manage the deployments and ensure their success. As a result, we use evaluations and certifications to guarantee that they have the product knowledge and an understanding of business procedures.</p>
<p>Our service providers and partners were evaluated by Frappe's partner team. The evaluations of Prymage Consultancy Ltd, Navari Limited, Anther Technologies Pvt Ltd, nVisionIT, and Phamos GmbH were completed successfully. With this qualification, they were able to become official partners.</p>
